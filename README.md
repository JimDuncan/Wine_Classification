# Wine_Classification
Simple project that given a set of attributes about a wine, attempts to classify whether the wine is White or Red.  This project uses three different types of classifiers, a support vector machine,logistic regression, and a random forrest.  Plotting the results on a ROC curve it is apparent for this specific problem, the random forrest is the best classifier.
